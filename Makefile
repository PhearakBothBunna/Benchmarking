# These tools are normally replaced with Ant, Maven, and Gradle for Java
#  Crandall is just still learning these systems so we're using make as
#  a hack solution for now, but make is widely used in other languages
#  as a build and system control tool so it's worth seeing


# Use an environment variable to store the name of the main .java file to build
# This allows us to choose the file expected by the 'test' target here
MAIN_SRC_FILE=Benchmarking

# The first target (string:) in the file is the 'default'
# This default just does the 'build' target and returns
default: build

# Build builds all of the java files in the directory - brute force 
build:
	javac -cp ./lib/junit4.jar *.java

# Run first build, then run the main program
#  if it did anything other than test
run: build
	@echo "Running input1.txt benchmark"
	java $(MAIN_SRC_FILE) input1.txt

# Test targets first run 'build', then run tests on the program as needed
#java -cp ./lib/junit4.jar:. org.junit.runner.JUnitCore $(MAIN_SRC_FILE)
test: run

# Run the larger benchmark
longrun: build
	@echo "Running larger input2.txt benchmark"
	@echo "NOTE: This could take many minutes, to even hours, depending upon your hardware and algorithm's implementation"
	java $(MAIN_SRC_FILE) input2.txt


# Clean targets remove temporary files, such as .class files

	rm -f *.class
