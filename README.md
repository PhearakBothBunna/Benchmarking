# Benchmarking- Programming Assignment for Advanced Data Structures class (Java)
The goal of this programming assignment is to benchmark or in other words to compare the time it takes
for the program/algorithm to read integers from input files and store it in a singly linked list by keeping
the list sorted at all time as well as the time to find minimum, maximum and median from the list. We can
test it by comparing the results from 2 different input files (by which one of them contains a lot more
elements than the other one) and analyze it.
